## Introduction

### Model generators

Model generators are artifacts that receive a set of conditions (in the form of meta-model, shapes, sizes and so on) and produce models that satisfy these conditions.

These types of tools can be applied to many areas of software and system engineering such as the testing and benchmarking of graph databases, to create complex test stubs in the object-oriented field or automated synthesis of prototypical test contexts in the assurance of smart cyber-physical systems.
