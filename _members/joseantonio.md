## About me
<img align="right" src="/assets/img/joseantonio.jpg"> I'm a predoctoral researcher at Universidad de Murcia, where I research about topics realted to Model Driven Engineering (MDE) and Machine Learning. I am also interested in model generators, recommender systems for Software Engineering, natural language processing and deep learning.

I obtained a BSc in Mathematics, a BSc in Computer Science and a MSc in Big Data from the University of Murcia. Currently, I am enrolled in a PhD program supervised by Jesús Sánchez Cuadrado.
