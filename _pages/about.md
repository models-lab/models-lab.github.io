We are a (small) research team focused on Software Engineering topics.
In particular, we seek to improve software development by
using models (as in UML models, but also ML models) and 
Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs). 

We have three main themes.

1. Model transformations

2. Domain-specific languages

3. Machine learning applied to modelling


<!--
We are a Biological Physics lab in the Department of Physics at UIUC. We study physical principles underlying molecular interactions and functions inside cells. Currently, our focus is how gene expression machines work together in the cellular context. We develop new methodologies based on molecular, optical, and computational approaches and ask critical molecule-level questions that matter for living cells.
-->

We are looking for highly energetic and motivated graduate students with a background in computer science and mathematics.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
